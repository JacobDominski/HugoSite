      <description>The Space Project was a group project at UAT where a team and I developed a payload to collect data in the atmosphere. My job was to construct the flight computer. The flight computer consisted of three layers: the sensors, printable circuit board, and the micro controller. I also wrote the software that would let the electronics talk to each other and send data to a micro SD card.</description>
