      <description>Dungeon Crawler is a console game written in C++ that mimics a Dungeons and Dragons style game. The objective of the game is to navigate your way through the dungeon by fighting enemies, and collecting items to use until you make your way out.There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of features in the game like a shop to buy and sell items, an inventory system to hold all your items, and a command system that will let the player do a variety of actions.</description>

      <description>The Space Project was a group project at UAT where a team and I developed a payload to collect data in the atmosphere. My job was to construct the flight computer. The flight computer consisted of three layers: the sensors, printable circuit board, and the micro controller. I also wrote the software that would let the electronics talk to each other and send data to a micro SD card.</description>
