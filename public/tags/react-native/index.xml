      <description>This is a mobile app using React Native to automate the proposal process for my client&amp;rsquo;s company. HVAC Proposals gives the technician the ability to create a proposal while in front of the customer which will ultimately increase sales opportunities. The technician will be able to do everything from the app including entering information on which type of system is needed, what they plan to do, and any additional add ons the customer is interested in.</description>
